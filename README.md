# a_fee_calculator
This Java program is built for my friend who wanted to calculate how much he would spend on accommodation during the second vacation of college. For the sake of lightness, I give up using the MVC structure. 

I haven't uploaded the .exe file to the repository for the purpose of privacy preservation. But you can find the.jar file here.
